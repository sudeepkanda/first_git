# first_git
this is my first git repository
when creating a repo I have seen something about licenses and git gnore what are those?
<h2>readme.md----> .md means mark down </h2>
while upadating we can comment why we are updation / changing

</br>git --version
</br>git --config username "name"
</br>git --config email"email address"
</br>git --config "list" ----->>> gives details of username and email
</br>git clone github project link(https copy and past here after clone key word)
</br>(cd --->> change directory (to move from one folder to another folder), tab ---> auto complete, clear to clear the command ,ls -->> lift all files from that folder/directory)
</br>git status -->> to check code is up to date and is it modified recently and not updated
